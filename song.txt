. Bright blue the sky,
Sun up on high,
That was the little boyâ€™s picture,
He drew for you,
Wrote for you, too,
Just to make clesr what he drew -
Refrain
May there always be sunshine,
May there always be blue skies,
May there always be Mummie,
May there always be me!

My little friend,
Listen, my friend,
Peace is the dream of the people,
Hearts old and young
Never have done
Singing the song you hqve sung.
Refrain.
