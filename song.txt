. Bright blue the sky,
Sun up on high,
That was the little boyâ€™s picture,
He drew for you,
Wrote for you, too,
Just to make clesr what he drew -
Refrain
May there always be sunshine,
May there always be blue skies,
May there always be Mummie,
May there always be me!

Soldier lad, stay!
Hear what we say -
War would make all of us losers.
Peace is our prize,
Millions of eyes
Anxiously gaze at the skies.
Refrain
